It‚Äôs tempting to dismiss that old research draft, that half-coded app, or the notebook full of scattered thoughts. But these fragments carry more weight than we realize. Every incomplete idea is a seed ‚Äî sometimes it just needs time, perspective, or the right people to help it grow.

When Steve Jobs dropped out of college, learned calligraphy, and tinkered with design ‚Äî none of it made sense then. But years later, those dots became the aesthetic soul of Apple. What you create today may feel pointless. But in hindsight, it might be the very moment your future self is grateful for.

So don‚Äôt be afraid of the unfinished. Embrace the mess. Trust your instincts. Keep building. Because masterpieces are often born out of abandoned drafts ‚Äî brought back to life by someone who refused to let them die.`,
