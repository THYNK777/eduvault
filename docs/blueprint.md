# **App Name**: EduVault

## Core Features:

- Vault Deposits: Allow users to 'Vault' their unfinished academic projects with appropriate tagging to classify the material. The classification system should mirror the Harry Potter magic system as follows: AI is divination, machine learning is runes, computer engineering is charms etc.
- Room of Unfinished Spells: Create a hub (The Room of Unfinished Spells) to host incomplete projects, sorted and classified by their magical fields/subjects. A Pensieve style tool should be included to help find very granular details inside of large, unorganized datasets.
- Order of the Project: Facilitate collaborative project revival, creating channels for team building and project ownership, known as the Order of the Project
- Felix Funding: Generate appropriate search queries via generative AI to assist with resource acquisition such as finding research grants or teaching mentors, called Felix Funding. Generative AI serves as a reasoning tool for sourcing connections between mentors, users, and funding resources.
- Hall of Brains: Each user gets a Hall of Brains. Allow students to showcase their individual projects, even the ones that are unfinished to display skills learned.
- Restricted Section Scrolls: A restricted scroll contains a weekly blog/video which 'disappears' after a short period, introducing time sensitive information and also gamifying usage of the application. Should the application's database expand in the future, the blog/video files themselves can also be vaulted to provide some benefit after they vanish, using Generative AI to create indexes for vaulted video or blog assets.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sapphire blue (#08306B), reminiscent of Hogwarts uniforms and the night sky.
- Background color: Dark navy blue (#0A192F), providing a sense of mystery and depth, like the Forbidden Forest.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFB833), evoking the magical elements and prestige of Gringotts.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, high-end, slightly vintage, Harry Potter-esque feel. Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability in longer texts.
- Incorporate magical icons that correlate with different project fields. Charms = gear; runes = nodes etc.
- The site's layout should emphasize a magical feeling, invoking locations from the franchise such as Hogwarts.
- Subtle, magical animations upon completing key functions (e.g., submitting the vault, forming the order, entering a term into the pensieve).
